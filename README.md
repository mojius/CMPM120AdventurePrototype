A simple adventure game by Ben Daly based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: Foyer, Balcony, Bedroom, Outside.
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: Intro and Attic.
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Constructor can be modified to change scene text color.
    - Constructor can be modified to change scene background color.

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: Foyer, Balcony, Bedroom, Outside.
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: For instance, the chairs on the balcony and the broken table, as well as the door. Every scene has at least one door, and at least one object that reacts to clicks.
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: Soooo much stuff. View of the mountains, chandelier, windows outside the mansion.
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: The skeleton, the bike, table, chairs, all doors.
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: Wiggly skeleton, wiggly chairs.

Asset sources:
- All assets were made by me in GIMP. Backgrounds were colored in-engine using code.

Code sources:
- `adventure.js` and `index.html` were created for this project [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and edited by me.
- `game.js` was sketched by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and rewritten by me.
